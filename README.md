This repository is the result of the final masterâ€™s project in Bioinformatics and Biostatis-tics (Universitat Oberta de Catalunya) entitle Are Nuclear Insertions of Mitochondrial Origin Pseudogenes?.

The "Dynamic_Report" folder contains an Rmarkdown document designed to generate a set of intermediate (.txt documents) and a final file called FINAL_OUTPUT_TABLE.txt with all relevant genetic content and with a more in-depth expression
and gene ontology study in the genes whithin a given genomic coordinates (Human Assembly GRCh37/hg19). By changing the input document and following the instructions in the .html file (also in "Dynamic_Report" folder), it is possible to generate a new set of intermediate and final documents with the new coordinates.
